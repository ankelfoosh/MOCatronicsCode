# Updating the code using your web browser

## Quick Start: Using GitHub directly (easiest)
1. Navigate to the file you want to update.
2. Click the "edit" icon in the upper left of the code window (looks like a pencil).
3. Edit the file as you need to (copy/paste in the entire new code contents from the day, overwrite the old code).
4. When finished, and when you are sure you got it right, click "Commit changes" (green button).
5. Type a short and descriptive "commit message", and when appropriate, a longer description in the "commit description".
6. Select "Commit directly to the main branch"
7. Click "Commit changes".
8. Done!

## Quick Start: Using the GitHub Web IDE 
 (a little harder, but more powerful, than directly in GitHub)
1. Press "." when viewing this repo on GitHub to open the GitHub web client.
2. Select the file you want to modify using the file browser (top icon on the left).
3. Make your edits/copy/paste the new code over the old code.
4. Click the "source control" icon on the left menu (third icon down).
5. Type a "commit message" with a short one-line description of your changes.
6. Select the file you edited and verify your code changes (the "diff").
7. When you're sure it's correct, press the "Commit & Push" green button.
